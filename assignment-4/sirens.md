# Assignment 4

For this lab, we recommend that students read the material in the references section of this page.
This assignment aims to show the use of a SIREN in practice. In previous assignments, we worked with ReLU and LeakyReLU activation functions. In this assignment, we will work with an activation function in sinusoidal form. <a href=" https://github.com/lvelho/blog/blob/master/explore_siren.ipynb" target="_blank">Click here</a> to open a simplified example of SIREN and follow the suggestions subsection instructions.

## Suggestions:

1. Create a copy of the notebook.
2. Run the cells; we recommend running them one by one to get familiar with the process.
3. The authors in the paper call attention to the adjustment of $ \omega_0 $ initialization. Into the notebook are suggestions for specific sections of the paper; we recommend the students read these parts and try to adjust the $\omega_0$ value. Afterward, the students can compare their results with the provided example and show us.
